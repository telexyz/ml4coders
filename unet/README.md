A primary design goal of Genann was to store all the network weights in one contigious block of memory. This makes it easy and efficient to train the network weights using direct-search numeric optimization algorthims, such as Hill Climbing, the Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, etc. These methods can be used by searching on the ANN's weights directly.
