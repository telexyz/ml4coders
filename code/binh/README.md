Donâ€™t jump into deep waters too hastily: while Deep Learning is no doubt one of the most

exciting areas in Machine Learning, you should master the fundamentals first. Moreover, most

problems can be solved quite well using simpler techniques such as Random Forests and

Ensemble methods (discussed in Part I). Deep Learning is best suited for complex problems

such as image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language processing, provided you

have enough data, computing power, and patience.
